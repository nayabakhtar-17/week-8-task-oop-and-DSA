Binary Search Tree (BST) for Student Data

Overview

This C++ program implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) to store and manage student data, including marks and gender. The program creates two separate BSTs, one for male students and one for female students, and provides options to insert data, display the BSTs using in-order traversal, and terminate the program.

Features

- Implementation of Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure
- Separate BSTs for male and female students
- Insertion of student data into respective BSTs based on gender
- In-order traversal to display the BSTs
- User-friendly menu-driven interface

Classes

- TreeNode: Represents a node in the BST, containing marks, gender, and pointers to left and right child nodes
- BST: Represents the Binary Search Tree, providing methods for insertion and in-order traversal

Functions

- insert: Inserts a new node into the BST
- inOrder: Performs in-order traversal of the BST and displays the nodes
- main: The main function, providing a menu-driven interface for user interaction

Usage

1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
2. Run the program
3. Choose an option from the menu:
    - 1: Create BSTs
    - 2: See Male Students' BST
    - 3: See Female Students' BST
    - 0: Terminate Program

Note

- The program uses a sample dataset for demonstration purposes. You can modify the dataset or add new data as needed.
- The program does not handle errors or exceptions. You may want to add error handling mechanisms for a more robust implementation.
